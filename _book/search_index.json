DID is a decentralized identity project in web3.0. It is an NFT based decentralized identity with features of decentralized storage and privacy. HashKey DID has lived on multiple blockchain, like Ethereum, PlatON, Klaytn, Polygon etc.\nThe system provides some basic functions: Registration, Authorization, KYC Service and Credential Issuance.\nRegistration\nThe DID name ends with .key suffix and DID avatar can be customized. DID length is between 5 and 54 words, it only allow numbers between 0-9 and alphabet between a-z. Once user has registered, the address and user name will be store in smart contract.\nAuthorization\nUser can use HashKey DID as his identity to log in other system as long as he authorizes his identity to it.\nKYC Service\nThere are some reputable brands cooperating with HashKey DID, user can get KYC from them. And then add KYC information to DID.\nIssue Credentials\nCredential records the unique on-chain footprints of individuals, \"freezes\" user's on-chain highlights and records active on-chain engagements and achievements. Institution can issue credentials to its user as an ecosystem incentives to reward active and outstanding community contributors and enhance user loyalty.\nHashKey DID Architecture\n The above is HashKey DID smart contract architecture. The smart contract collect these information:\n\nThe owner of this name\nCredentials related to that address\nKYC information\nCredentials Issuer\n\nHashKey DID protocol consist two different parts. One is DID smart contract, an ERC721 contract. DID contract include four major functionality: Registration, Authorization, KYC Service and Credential Issuance. Institution issue credentials for its user, DID contract would create a new contract called DeedGrain. It's an ERC1155 token. Issuer can choose how to motivate user either through fungible token or non-fungible token.\nGetting Started\nFor DAPP developers and contract developers, HashKey DID document provide comprehensive guidance.\nI'm contract developer and I want to interact with HashKey DID\\\nCheck out the Contract Developer Guide, starting with ContractAPI\nI'm DAPP developer and I want HashKey DID support to my DAPP\\\nCheck out the DAPP Developer Guide, starting with Developer\n"},"terminology.html":{"url":"terminology.html","title":"Terminology","keywords":"","body":"Terminology\n\nDID: Decentralized Identity\nCredential: On chain reward, credential records the unique on-chain footprints of individuals, \"freezes\" user's on-chain highlights and records active on-chain engagements and achievements.\nEvidence: Signed message by HashKey DID.\nResolver: A resolver is a contract that maps from name to the resource (e.g., cryptocurrency addresses, content hash, etc). Resolvers are pointed to by the resolver field of the registry.\nRegistry: The core contract of HashKey DID, mapping from user name to user address.\nKYC: KYC means Know Your Customer and sometimes Know Your Client. KYC or KYC check is the mandatory process of identifying and verifying the client's identity when opening an account and periodically over time.\n\n"},"faq.html":{"url":"faq.html","title":"FAQ","keywords":"","body":"FAQ\nData Security/Privacy\nHashkey DID adopts a decentralized method to storage user data. Except for the private key holder or the user authorized, no third-party organization can modify or delete user data. All Hashkey DID related contracts are mainly deployed on PlatON, which combining blockchain and privacy-preserving computation technologies, all user data on  chains is protected, all User-uploaded data is optional and not mandatory.\nUsage scenarios\nHashkey DID is essentially an ERC721 NFT that cannot be traded. If APP that support NFT, it can be displayed as a user avatar or login in as usereg: twitter.  Hashkey DID provides a simpler platform for users to enter the web3.0 world. DID users can use Hashkey DID platform to issue NFTs or Credentials for their own projects, creating greater value for their projects.\nProduct Features\nAt present, users can publish ERC721 and ERC1155 NFTs through the Hashkey DID platform. Users only need to refer to NFT to publish their own projects directly.

DID user can display the personal information by resolver contract. all of the information is optional.\nReverse resolution\nWe are familiar with DNS resolution which is to resolve the domain name to the IP address, and reverse resolution means website IP address be resolved to the domain name of the website. The reverse resolution of DID is similar to the reverse resolution of DNS in that it supports associating human-readable names with blockchain addresses and resolving machine-readable identifiers to human-readable identifiers.\nSet reverse resolution\nDID reverse resolution information are stored in the DID registry contract. When a user register DID, the mapping relationship between DID and user address will be recorded in the tokenId2Did mapping table. Although we retain the mapping relationship, it is up to the user to decide whether to use the reverse resolution. When the user needs to use reverse resolution, he can call the following function in the Resolver contract to turn on, which is unavailable by default.\nfunction setReverse(bool isReverse) public;\n\n\nisReverse: true/false\n\nGet reverse resolution\nTo use the reverse resolution function, you only need to call the following function in the Resolver contract.\nfunction name(address _addr) public view returns (string memory);\n\n\naddr: get addr's DID name\n\nBlockchain addresses\nWallet developers are beginning to require the ability to resolve multiple blockchain addresses in the DID, and this specification standardizes the means of entering and retrieving these addresses. Users can set multiple blockchain addresses for DID.\nAdd address\nCall the following function to add the address for DID. coinType is the cryptocurrency type indexed by SLIP44.\nfunction setAddr(uint256 tokenId, uint256 coinType, bytes memory _addr) public authorized(tokenId);\n\n\ntokenId: DID tokenId\ncoinType: the cryptocurrency type indexed by SLIP44\n_addr: blockchain address\n\nGet address\nAccess the DID-bound blockchain addresses and call the following function.\nfunction addr(uint256 tokenId, uint256 coinType) public view returns(bytes memory);\n\n\ntokenId: DID tokenId\ncoinType: the cryptocurrency type indexed by SLIP44\n\nEcdsa secp256k1 public key\nDID users can set the Ecdsa secp256K1 public key. When the user uses the private key to sign information, the receiver can use the public key to verify the signature. When the receiver wants to encrypt the communication with the DID User, the receiver can use the public key to encrypt the communication information, and the DID User uses the private key to decrypt the information.\nSet public key\nIn the resolver contract, the following function is called to set the public key.\nfunction setPubkey(uint256 tokenId, bytes32 x, bytes32 y) external authorized(tokenId);\n\n\ntokenId: DID tokenId\nx: the x coordinate of the curve point for the public key\ny: the y coordinate of the curve point for the public key\n\nGet public key\nCall the following function to query the public key.\nfunction pubkey(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (bytes32 x, bytes32 y);\n\n\ntokenId: DID tokenId\n\nText\nThe user can set some attributes for DID eg: name, age to store.\nSet text\nThe following function is used to set text.\nfunction setText(uint256 tokenId, string calldata key, string calldata value) external authorized(tokenId);\n\n\ntokenId: DID tokenId\nkey: eg: name\nvalue: eg: allen\n\nNote: The avatar field is used when the user wants to set an avatar for himself. The field value URI should follow the following rules:\n\nHTTP: If you provide an HTTP URI, it should be able to parse directly into an avatar image, rather than a traditional HTML page, metadata, or other content.\nIPFS: If an IPFS URI is provided, it should be able to parse directly into an avatar image. Clients without built-in IPFS support can rewrite the URI as an HTTPS URL referencing the IPFS gateway before parsing. As described in this document.\nNFT: NFT can also be used as the profile picture of DID. When setting the profile picture URI, you need to follow the following standards:\nnft:chainId:tokenType:contractAddress:tokenId\n\n\nnft: protocol name\nchainId: chain ID\ntokenType: token type, eg: 721/1155\ncontractAddress: contract address\ntokenId: NFT's tokenId\n\n\n\nGet text\nThe following function is used to query the text.\nfunction text(uint256 tokenId, string calldata key) external view returns (string memory);\n\n\ntokenId: DID tokenId\nkey: eg: name\n\n"},"developer-guide/contract-api-reference/kyc.html":{"url":"developer-guide/contract-api-reference/kyc.html","title":"KYC","keywords":"","body":"KYC\nKYC means Know Your Customer.
