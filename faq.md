## Data Security/Privacy
HashKey DID adopts a decentralized method to store user data. Except for the private key holder or the user authorized, no third-party organization can modify or delete user data. HashKey DID related contracts are mainly deployed on [PlatON](https://www.platon.network) which combines blockchain and privacy-preserving computation. All user data on chains is protected and all user-uploaded data is optional.

## Usage Scenarios
HashKey DID is essentially an ERC721 NFT that cannot be transferred. HashKey DID can be displayed as a user avatar or login in as user when APPs`eg: twitter` support web3.0. HashKey DID provides a simpler platform for users to enter the web3.0. DID users can use HashKey DID platform to issue NFTs or Credentials for their own projects.

## Product Features
At present, users can publish ERC721 and ERC1155 NFTs through the HashKey DID platform. Users only need to refer to NFT to issue credentials for their own projects directly. We are currently cooperating with more projects to issue credentials for users' behavior in web3.0 to encourage users to join projects deeply, and jointly issue digital certificates or verifiable claims with well-known institutions.
