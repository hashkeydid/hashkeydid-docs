# Sync

HashKey DID is a decentralized identity that supports multiple chains. The synchronization protocol is implemented through the [LayerZero protocol](contract-api-reference/layerzero.md). However, some chains are not yet supported by LayerZero, so we use middleware that we have developed to synchronize the DID with those chains.
